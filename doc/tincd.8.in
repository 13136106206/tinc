.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the daemon of tinc, a secure virtual private network (VPN) project.
When started,
.Nm
will read it's configuration file to determine what virtual subnets it has to serve
and to what other tinc daemons it should connect.
It will connect to the ethertap or tun/tap device
and set up a socket for incoming connections.
Optionally a script will be executed to further configure the virtual device.
If that succeeds,
it will detach from the controlling terminal and continue in the background,
accepting and setting up connections to other tinc daemons
that are part of the virtual private network.
Under Windows (not Cygwin) tinc will install itself as a service,
which will be restarted automatically after reboots.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c, -config Ns = Ns Ar DIR
Read configuration files from
.Ar DIR
instead of
.Pa @sysconfdir@/tinc/ .
.It Fl D, -no-detach
Don't fork and detach.
This will also disable the automatic restart mechanism for fatal errors.
If not mentioned otherwise, this will show log messages on the standard error output.
.It Fl d, -debug Ns Op = Ns Ar LEVEL
Increase debug level or set it to
.Ar LEVEL
(see below).
.It Fl n, -net Ns = Ns Ar NETNAME
Connect to net
.Ar NETNAME .
.It Fl L, -mlock
Lock tinc into main memory.
This will prevent sensitive data like shared private keys to be written to the system swap files/partitions.
.It Fl -logfile Ns Op = Ns Ar FILE
Write log entries to a file instead of to the system logging facility.
If
.Ar FILE
is omitted, the default is
.Pa @localstatedir@/log/tinc. Ns Ar NETNAME Ns Pa .log.
.It Fl -controlsocket Ns = Ns Ar FILENAME
Open control socket at
.Ar FILENAME .
If
.Ar FILE
is omitted, the default is
.Pa @localstatedir@/run/tinc. Ns Ar NETNAME Ns Pa .control.
.It Fl -bypass-security
Disables encryption and authentication of the meta protocol.
Only useful for debugging.
.It Fl -help
Display short list of options.
.It Fl -version
Output version information and exit.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It HUP
Partially rereads configuration files.
Connections to hosts whose host config file are removed are closed.
New outgoing connections specified in
.Pa tinc.conf
will be made.

.Sh DEBUG LEVELS
The tinc daemon can send a lot of messages to the syslog.
The higher the debug level,
the more messages it will log.
Each level inherits all messages of the previous level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
This will log a message indicating
.Nm
has started along with a version number.
It will also log any serious error.
.It 1
This will log all connections that are made with other tinc daemons.
.It 2
This will log status and error messages from scripts and other tinc daemons.
.It 3
This will log all requests that are exchanged with other tinc daemons. These include
authentication, key exchange and connection list updates.
.It 4
This will log a copy of everything received on the meta socket.
.It 5
This will log all network traffic over the virtual private network.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa @sysconfdir@/tinc/
Directory containing the configuration files tinc uses.
For more information, see
.Xr tinc.conf 5 .
.It Pa @localstatedir@/run/tinc. Ns Ar NETNAME Ns Pa .pid
The PID of the currently running
.Nm
is stored in this file.
