.TH TINCD 8 "June 2000" "tinc version 1.0pre3" "FSF"
.SH NAME
tinc \- tinc VPN daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tincd
[\fIoption\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

This is the daemon of tinc, a secure virtual private
network (VPN) project. When started, tincd will read
it's configuration file to determine what virtual subnet
it has to serve and to what other tinc daemons it should connect.
It will connect to the ethertap device and set up a socket for incomming
connections.
If that succeeds, it will detach from the controlling terminal and
continue in the background, accepting and setting up connections to other
tinc daemons that are part of the virtual private network.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Read configuration options from FILE.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-no\-detach\fR
Don't fork and detach.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Increase debug level.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-kill\fR
Attempt to kill a running tincd and exit.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-net\fR=\fINETNAME\fR
Connect to net NETNAME.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR
Seconds to wait before giving a timeout.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit.
.TP

.PP
.SH "SIGNALS"
.TP
\fBHUP\fR
Closes all connections, rereads the configuration file and restarts the daemon.
.TP
\fBINT\fR
Closes all connections and quits.
.TP
\fBUSR1\fR
Dumps the connection list to syslog.
.TP
\fBUSR2\fR
Invalidates the current cryptographic key and generates a new one.
.TP
\fBALRM\fR
Forces tincd to try to connect to an uplink immediately. Usually tincd attempts
to do this itself, but increases the time it waits between the attempts each time
it failed, and if tincd didn't succeed to connect to an uplink the first time after
it started, it defaults to the maximum time of 15 minutes.
.PP
.SH "DEBUG LEVELS"
The tinc daemon can send a lot of messages to the syslog. The more \fB\-d\fR options are
given to tincd, the more messages it will log. Each level inherits all messages of the
previous level:
.TP
\fIno debug options\fR
This will log a message indicating tincd has started along with a version number.
It will also any serious error.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
This will log all connections that are made with other tinc daemons.
.TP
\fB\-d \-d\fR
This will log all requests that are exchanged with other tinc daemons. These include
authentication, key exchange and connection list updates.
.TP
\fB\-d \-d \-d\fR
This will log a copy of everything received on the meta socket.
.TP
\fB\-d \-d \-d \-d\fR
This will log all packets that are sent over the virtual private network.
.PP
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fI/etc/tinc/<NETNAME>/tinc.conf\fR
The configuration file for tincd.
.TP
\fI/etc/tinc/<NETNAME>/passphrases/*\fR
The directory containing the secret passphrases
used to authenticate other tinc daemons.
.PP
.SH "BUGS"
Maintaining a connection list on each tinc daemon that can connect and disconnect at any
moment, and making sure that all connections satisfy the tree property isn't easy. Although
we have done a lot to make sure tinc is sturdy and foolproof, it might happen that
some connection lists get corrupted.
.PP
If you find any bugs, report them to tinc@nl.linux.org.
.PP
.SH "TODO"
A lot. If something you would like to see is not implemented, just ask; we most certainly will.
