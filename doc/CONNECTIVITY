1. Problem
==========

We have a set of nodes (A, B, C, ...) that are part of the same VPN. They need
to connect to eachother and form a single graph that satisfies the tree
property.

There is the possibility that loops are formed, the offending connections must
be eliminated.

Suppose we start with two smaller graphs that want to form a single larger
graph. Both graphs consist of three nodes:

  A-----B-----C
  
  

  D-----E-----F
  
It is very well possible that A wants to connect to D, and F wants to connect
to C, both at the same time. The following loop will occur:

  A-----B-----C
  |           ^
  |           |
  v           |
  D-----E-----F

The situation described here is totally symmetric, there is no preference to
one connection over the other. The problem of resolving the loop, maintaining
consistency and stability is therefore not a trivial one.

What happens when A---D and C---F are connected to eachother? They exchange
lists of known hosts. A knows of B and C, and D knows of E and F. The protocol
defines ADD_HOST messages, from now on we will say that "node X sends and
ADD_HOST(Y) to Z".

There are two possible scenarios: either both A---D and C---F finish
authentication at the same time, or A---D finishes first, so that ADD_HOST
messages will reach C and F before they finish authentication.

1.1 A---D finishes first
------------------------

After A---D authentication finishes the following actions are taken:

  1 A sends ADD_HOST(B) to D
    A sends ADD_HOST(C) to D
    D sends ADD_HOST(E) to A
    D sends ADD_HOST(F) to A

  2 A sends ADD_HOST(D) to B
    A receives ADD_HOST(E) from D:
      A sends ADD_HOST(E) to B
    A receives ADD_HOST(F) from D:
      A sends ADD_HOST(F) to B
    D sends ADD_HOST(A) to E
    D receives ADD_HOST(B) from A:
      D sends ADD_HOST(B) to E
    D receives ADD_HOST(C) from A:
      D sends ADD_HOST(C) to E

  3 B receives ADD_HOST(D) from A,
      B sends ADD_HOST(D) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(E) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(E) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(F) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(F) to C
    E receives ADD_HOST(A) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(A) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(B) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(B) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(C) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(C) to F

  4 C receives ADD_HOST(D) from B.
    C receives ADD_HOST(E) from B.
    C receives ADD_HOST(F) from B.
    F receives ADD_HOST(A) from E.
    F receives ADD_HOST(B) from E.
    F receives ADD_HOST(C) from E.

Then C---F authentication finishes, the following actions are taken:

  1 C notes that F is already known:
      Connection is closed.
    F notes that C is already known:
      Connection is closed.

1.2 Both A---D and C---F finish at the same time.
-------------------------------------------------

  1 A sends ADD_HOST(B) to D
    A sends ADD_HOST(C) to D
    D sends ADD_HOST(E) to A
    D sends ADD_HOST(F) to A
    
    C sends ADD_HOST(A) to F
    C sends ADD_HOST(B) to F
    F sends ADD_HOST(D) to C
    F sends ADD_HOST(E) to C

  2 A sends ADD_HOST(D) to B
    A receives ADD_HOST(E) from D:
      A sends ADD_HOST(E) to B
    A receives ADD_HOST(F) from D:
      A sends ADD_HOST(F) to B
    D sends ADD_HOST(A) to E
    D receives ADD_HOST(B) from A:
      D sends ADD_HOST(B) to E
    D receives ADD_HOST(C) from A:
      D sends ADD_HOST(C) to E

    C sends ADD_HOST(F) to B
    C receives ADD_HOST(D) from F:
      A sends ADD_HOST(D) to B
    C receives ADD_HOST(E) from F:
      A sends ADD_HOST(E) to B
    F sends ADD_HOSTS(C) to E
    F receives ADD_HOST(A) from C:
      D sends ADD_HOST(A) to E
    F receives ADD_HOST(B) from C:
      D sends ADD_HOST(B) to E

  3 B receives ADD_HOST(D) from A,
      B sends ADD_HOST(D) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(E) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(E) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(F) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(F) to C
    E receives ADD_HOST(A) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(A) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(B) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(B) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(C) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(C) to F
    
    B receives ADD_HOST(F) from C, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    B receives ADD_HOST(D) from C, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    B receives ADD_HOST(E) from C, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(C) from F, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(A) from F, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(B) from F, and notes that is is already known:
      <insert solution here>

  4 A receives ADD_HOST(D) from B, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    A receives ADD_HOST(E) from B, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    A receives ADD_HOST(F) from B, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    F receives ADD_HOST(A) from E, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    F receives ADD_HOST(B) from E, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    F receives ADD_HOST(B) from E, and notes that it is already known:
      <insert solution here>

    ...

1.2.1 Augmenting ADD_HOST
-------------------------

A solution would be to augment ADD_HOST with an extra parameter, for example
the host which told us about the new host. From A's point of view, D told it
about itself, E and F. So, A would send out ADD_HOST(D, D) to B, and
ADD_HOST(E,D) and ADD_HOST(F,D). Lets review what happens at point 3 in the
preceding example:

  3 B receives ADD_HOST(D,D) from A,
      B sends ADD_HOST(D,D) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(E,D) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(E,D) to C
    B receives ADD_HOST(F,D) from A:
      B sends ADD_HOST(F,D) to C
    E receives ADD_HOST(A,A) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(A,A) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(B,A) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(B,A) to F
    E receives ADD_HOST(C,A) from D:
      E sends ADD_HOST(C,A) to F
    
    B receives ADD_HOST(F,F) from C, and notes that F is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    B receives ADD_HOST(D,F) from C, and notes that D is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    B receives ADD_HOST(E,F) from C, and notes that E is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(C,C) from F, and notes that C is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(A,C) from F, and notes that A is already known:
      <insert solution here>
    E receives ADD_HOST(B,C) from F, and notes that B is already known:
      <insert solution here>
