I would like to thank

   bug or two)
 * Mads Kiilerich (for finding some bugs and some errors in the
   documentation, and for making several suggestions to make it all
   more userfriendly)
 * James B. MacLean (for fixing several mission critical bugs, and for
   giving me a few good ideas, and, most of all, for the wonderful
   testing and debugging)
 * Cris van Pelt
 * Robert van der Meulen
 * Sander Smeenk
 * Tijs van Bakel
 * Wessel Dankers (for the name `tinc' and being a royal pain in the
   ass (je hebt erom gevraagd))
