TODO LIST

* Stop using UDP source address as the identifier of the remote tinc daemon.
  Use a unique number sent along with ANS_KEY.

* Efficient multicast support.

* Check if caches using hash tables speed up route.c.

* Streamline the meta protocol. Use a binary format?

* Add (hooks for) a (graphical) frontend, like Pokey.

* Implement future goals as mentioned on the website.
