Things left to do to make cabal superstable:
--------------------------------------------
 * Check for connection loops. Inter-daemon
   connections should always satisfy the
   tree property.
 * Check for duplicates. If there's a
   timeout and a host reconnects before the
   old connection is closed, duplicate
   entries appear in every connection list.
 * Redundancy: multiple ConnectTo lines, if
   one fails others might be tried.
 * Persistence: don't quit when no connection
   can be made directly after start of the
   daemon.
