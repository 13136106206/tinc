This version of tinc relies on the GNU Multi-Precision Library
(gmp). This library is available from your nearest GNU mirror. Please
install this first even before trying to run configure. If you don't
do this, configure will (hopefully) mention it to you.

This version of tinc supports multiple virtual networks at once. To
use this feature, you may supply a netname via the -n or --net
options. The standard locations for the config files will then be
/etc/tinc/<net>/. Because of this feature, tinc will send packets
directly to their destinations, instead of to the uplink. If this
behaviour is undesirable (for instance because of firewalls or
other restrictions), please use an older version of tinc (I would
recommend tinc-0.2.19).

In this version, MAC addresses are stripped off before encoding and
sending a packet. When the packet reaches its destination, the MAC
addresses are rebuilt again. They then have the form
FE:FD:aa:bb:cc:dd. aa, bb, cc and dd are taken from the destination
and source IP address.

tincd regenerates its encryption key pairs. It does this on the first
activity after the keys have expired. This period is adjustable in the
configuration file, and the default time is 3600 seconds (one
hour). If you send a USR2 signal to the daemon, it'll regenerate
immediately.
